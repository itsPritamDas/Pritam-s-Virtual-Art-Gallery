## 🧠 How It Works

1. Artworks are defined in a JavaScript object (`script.js`).
2. HTML dynamically renders cards based on the selected category.
3. Clicking an artwork triggers a fullscreen modal with zoom.
4. CSS handles light/dark themes and transitions.
5. Users can switch tabs, search, and toggle sound/theme.
